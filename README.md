and other tools for it ready to use in any .NET program.

## Build

* To build it from console, run `build.sh` or `build.cmd`
* To build it from Visual Studio, you will need VisualStudio 2017 and extensions: Paket.VisualStudio and NUnit3TestAdapter (they are easily obtainable from inside Visual Studio, Extensions and Updates menu item).
